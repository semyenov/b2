# Game List Enhancements

## 🎯 Overview

The game list has been significantly enhanced with:
- **Visual indicators** showing games with real players vs placeholders
- **Direct join capability** from the list - no need to copy/paste Game IDs
- **Watch mode** for full games or observation
- **Smart filtering** showing which games have available slots

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Visual Indicators

Games in the list now show clear status indicators:

```
👥 a1b2c3d4 - Alice, Bob - 5 moves [JOIN]      ← Has real players + slots available
👥 e5f6g7h8 - Charlie, Dave - 12 moves         ← Has real players, full
🤖 i9j0k1l2 - Player 1, Player 2 - 0 moves [JOIN]  ← Only placeholders + slots
```

**Indicators:**
- `👥` = Has real players (active game)
- `🤖` = Only placeholder names (waiting for players)
- `[JOIN]` = Has available player slots

### 2. Direct Join from List

Select any game with `[JOIN]` tag to:
1. **Join as player** - Enter your name and take an available slot
2. **Watch only** - Press `[w]` to spectate without playing

### 3. Smart Game Selection

**Games with slots:**
- Shows join dialog
- Option to join as player OR watch

**Full games:**
- Automatically opens in watch mode
- You join as observer (no player name)

}
```

**Available Slots:**

hasAvailableSlots(game) {
  // Any placeholder EXCEPT "Player 1" (creator's placeholder)
  return game.players.some(p => p.startsWith('Player ') && p !== 'Player 1')
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Game appears but no [JOIN] tag"

**Cause:** All player slots are taken
**Solution:** Select game to watch, or wait for a slot to open

### "Joined but can't make moves"

**Cause:** Not your turn OR you're in watch mode
**Solution:** 
- Check "Playing as: Your Name" appears at top
- Wait for your turn (watch for "▶ Your turn!" message)

### "Name rejected when joining"

**Cause:** Name already taken in that game
**Solution:** Try a different name

### Indicators not showing correctly

**Cause:** Game state may be stale
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Refresh the game list
Press [b] to go back
Select "List All Games" again
```
