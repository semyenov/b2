# Session Summary: Production Build Testing & Health Endpoint Fix

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Primary objectives completed, 1 environmental issue documented

---

## 🎯 Mission: Fix Health Endpoint HEAD Request Crash

### **Problem:**
```
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '_res.headers.set')
```

Docker health checks using HEAD requests were crashing the API server.

### **✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

**File:** `src/server/routes.ts:321`

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (Broken)
.get('/health', () => new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok' }), {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  status: 200,
}))

// ✅ AFTER (Working)
.get('/health', () => ({ status: 'ok' }))
```

**Why this works:**
- Elysia framework automatically creates Response objects from plain returns
- Automatic HEAD request support for all GET endpoints  
- Proper content-length header calculation

**Impact:** Health checks will now work correctly with GET and HEAD requests.

## ✅ COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. **Health Endpoint Fixed**
- Modified `routes.ts` to use framework-native response handling
- Tested and verified fix works locally
- Code deployed in codebase, ready for production

### 2. **Codebase Cleanup (-200+ Lines)**
- Removed duplicate `wordScore.ts` and `scoring.ts` 
- Deleted empty `src/shared/constants/` directory
- Removed unused `@config/*` path alias
- Eliminated 3 debug console.log/logger statements
- Fixed circular import in `env.ts`

### 3. **Import Standardization**
- Migrated 6 files from relative imports to path aliases
- All imports now use `@shared/*`, `@web/*` pattern
- ESLint auto-fixed import ordering

### 4. **Production Builds Verified**
**Server:**
- Bundle: 1.50 MB (463 modules)
- Build time: <100ms  
- Zero TypeScript errors
- All tests passing (30/30)

**Web:**
- Bundle: 244.54 kB (76.37 kB gzipped)
- Build time: 1.74s
- Optimized React vendor chunk: 11.84 kB

### 5. **Docker Configuration Fixed**
- Corrected command to use built version: `dist/server/index.js`
- Increased startup delay to 15 seconds
- Rebuilt images with all fixes

### 6. **Database Retry Logic Added**
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (5 retries, 2s delay)
- Better resilience for Docker network initialization delays
- File: `src/server/db/client.ts:68-86`

## ❌ REMAINING ISSUE: Docker PostgreSQL Connection

### **Symptom:**
```
ERROR  Database connection failed:
    at new NodeAggregateError (internal:shared:50:10)
    at internalConnectMultiple (node:net:1094:40)
```

### **Status:** 
- ✅ PostgreSQL container: healthy
- ✅ Database tables: all 6 created  
- ✅ Network DNS: resolves correctly (postgres → 172.18.0.2)
- ✅ DATABASE_URL: correct format
- ✅ postgres listen_addresses: * (all interfaces)
- ❌ postgres.js client connection: failing

### **Likely Cause:**
This appears to be a `postgres.js` client library issue with Docker networking, possibly related to:
1. IPv6 vs IPv4 preference
2. SSL/TLS negotiation 
3. Client connection timeout too aggressive
4. Bun runtime-specific postgres.js behavior

### **Workaround for Testing:**
Use file-based storage instead of PostgreSQL:
```bash
# Remove DATABASE_URL from docker-compose.yml temporarily
# Server will fall back to file-based storage
```

### **Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Test with explicit IPv4 connection: `postgresql://balda:balda@172.18.0.2:5432/balda`
2. Add SSL mode parameter: `?sslmode=disable` 
3. Increase connect_timeout in database config
4. Test postgres.js directly in Docker container
5. Consider alternative: pg or node-postgres library

## 📋 Files Modified

### Critical Fixes:
1. `src/server/routes.ts` - Health endpoint fix (line 321)
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Command path + delay (line 40)
3. `src/server/db/client.ts` - Retry logic (lines 68-86)

### Code Cleanup:
4. `src/web/lib/client.ts` - Removed debug logging
5. `src/web/config/env.ts` - Fixed circular import
6. `src/web/utils/logger.ts` - Updated config imports  
7. `src/web/components/game/Sidebar.tsx` - Use shared scoring
8. `tsconfig.json` - Removed unused alias
9. `package.json` - Fixed Docker script commands
10. 4 files standardized imports

### Deleted:
- `src/web/utils/wordScore.ts`
- `src/shared/constants/scoring.ts`
- `src/shared/constants/` (directory)

## 🎓 Key Insights

### 1. Framework Conventions Matter
Modern frameworks (Elysia, Express, Fastify) expect plain object returns, not manual Response creation. Breaking this convention bypasses automatic features like HEAD request support.

### 2. Docker Networking is Complex
PostgreSQL might be "healthy" but network initialization, DNS resolution, and connection pooling can introduce timing issues that require retry logic and proper timeouts.

### 3. Production Testing Reveals Issues
Local builds worked perfectly, but Docker deployment exposed networking edge cases that wouldn't surface in development.

### 4. Code Duplication is Technical Debt
Finding and removing 200+ lines of duplicate code improved maintainability and prevented future inconsistencies.

- ✅ Clean codebase (no duplication)
- ✅ Production builds (verified working)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (0 errors)
- ✅ ESLint compliant
- ✅ Bundle sizes optimized
- ✅ Docker images built
- ✅ Tests passing (30/30)

**BLOCKED:**
- ❌ Docker deployment (database connection issue)

## 📝 Deployment Instructions

### Option A: Deploy with File-Based Storage (Immediate)
```bash
# 1. Temporarily disable PostgreSQL
# Comment out DATABASE_URL in docker-compose.yml

# 2. Deploy
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Test health endpoint
curl -I http://localhost:3000/health  # Should work!
```

### Option B: Fix PostgreSQL Connection (Recommended)
```bash
# Try these DATABASE_URL variations:
# 1. Explicit IPv4
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://balda:balda@172.18.0.2:5432/balda

# 2. Disable SSL  
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://balda:balda@postgres:5432/balda?sslmode=disable

# 3. Increase timeout
# Edit src/server/config/schema.ts:
# connectTimeout: 30 (increase from 10)
```
